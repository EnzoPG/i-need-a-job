# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Read Before Anything Else

Read in this exact order before any implementation:

1. context/project-overview.md
2. context/architecture.md
3. context/ui-tokens.md
4. context/ui-rules.md
5. context/ui-registry.md
6. context/code-standards.md
7. context/library-docs.md
8. context/build-plan.md
9. context/progress-tracker.md

## Rules That Never Change

- Never use hardcoded hex values or raw Tailwind color classes
- Update `progress-tracker.md` and `ui-registry.md` after every feature
- Before any third party library — load its installed skill first,
  then read `context/library-docs.md` for project-specific rules
- If the same problem persists after one corrective prompt —
  stop immediately and run /recover

## Available Skills

- `/architect` — before any complex feature. Think before building.
- `/imprint` — after any new UI component. Capture patterns.
- `/review` — before demo or when something feels off.
- `/recover` — when something breaks after one failed correction.
- `/remember save` — when a feature spans multiple sessions.
- `/remember restore` — when returning after a multi-session feature.

# InsForge SDK Documentation - Overview

## What is InsForge?

Backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform providing:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostgREST API
- **Authentication**: Email/password + OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- **Storage**: File upload/download
- **AI**: OpenRouter key provisioning and model catalog for direct OpenAI-compatible integrations
- **Functions**: Serverless function deployment
- **Realtime**: WebSocket pub/sub (database + client events)

## Backend Details

- **API Base URL**: `https://yhzmui39.ap-southeast.insforge.app`
- **Anon Key**: `anon_f6234b7acaaa7197dc543b49268e883a79ab71740f5ffdef2518bc3a675a3276`

## When to Use SDK vs MCP Tools

### Always SDK for Application Logic:

- Authentication (register, login, logout, profiles)
- Database CRUD (select, insert, update, delete)
- Storage operations (upload, download files)
- AI integration via the provisioned OpenRouter key with the OpenAI SDK or OpenRouter HTTP API
- Serverless function invocation
- Payments checkout and customer portal session creation

### Use MCP Tools for Infrastructure:

- Project scaffolding (`download-template`) - Download starter templates with InsForge integration
- Backend setup and metadata (`get-backend-metadata`)
- Database schema management (`run-raw-sql`, `get-table-schema`)
- Storage bucket creation (`create-bucket`, `list-buckets`, `delete-bucket`)
- Serverless function deployment (`create-function`, `update-function`, `delete-function`)
- Frontend deployment (`create-deployment`) - Deploy frontend apps to InsForge hosting
